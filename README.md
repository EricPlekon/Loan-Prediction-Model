# Loan-Prediction-Model

This project contains a Python script for building and evaluating machine learning models to predict loan status using the 'loa-train.csv' dataset. The script also processes and predicts loan status on a separate test dataset 'loan-test.csv'.

The script starts out by importing necessary libraries: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, sklearn Load and exploring the dataset Data Visualization - visualize various aspects of the dataset Data Preprocessing - log transformation and handling missing values Splitting the Dataset Encoding Categorical Variables Featire Scaling Model Training Test Data Preprocessing and Prediction
